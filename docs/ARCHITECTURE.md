# Proposed architecture

Status: **proposed**, to be validated by Milestone 0 against the exact bundled CLI.

## 1. Design principles

1. **Pi-facing and ACP-facing state machines are separate.** The event mapper is the only translation layer.
2. **One owner of conversation history.** Track what the live ACP session has seen.
3. **Capabilities are earned, not assumed.** Advertise only implemented ACP client features and gate optional behavior on handshake responses.
4. **Every async resource has one owner and one teardown path.** Processes, RPCs, timers, permission requests, MCP calls, and listeners are generation-scoped.
5. **Safe failure beats transparent magic.** Deny permission, reconstruct context, or restart rather than guess.
6. **Bundle public entry points; never import Gemini internals.** The child process is the compatibility boundary.

## 2. Proposed repository/module layout

```

The extension entry must contain no transport or protocol logic. It creates one runtime, registers the provider and permission/diagnostic command, and hooks `session_shutdown`/reload disposal.

## 3. Runtime component model

### Provider

A complete provider has:

- id `gemini-acp`, name `Gemini CLI (ACP)`;
- ambient/API-key auth adapter;
- synchronous fallback models;
- `refreshModels` that obtains and publishes an authenticated ACP catalog;
- shared `stream`/`streamSimple` implementation;
- no network `baseUrl` because requests go to a local child.

Use a custom API id such as `gemini-acp`. Model ids should equal ACP `modelId` unless collision/normalization forces an encoding. Names come from ACP. Store the upstream id separately only if Pi ids must be transformed.

### Runtime/session manager

The manager owns processes and bindings:

```ts
interface Binding {
  piSessionId: string;
  cwd: string;
  processGeneration: number;
  acpSessionId: string;
  effectiveModelId: string;
  modeId?: string;
  messageWatermark: number;
  prefixFingerprint: string;
  initializedContextHash?: string;
  state: "idle" | "prompting" | "awaiting-permission" | "dead";
}
```

A binding queue serializes user prompts and continuations. Never key solely by cwd. If Pi omits `sessionId` or sends `cacheRetention: "none"` (a one-off request such as a compaction summary), create an ephemeral binding scoped to the runtime call chain; do not share arbitrary conversations by cwd.

The v1 implementation uses one process per active binding for isolation and simple cancellation. Catalog discovery uses a separate process that closes after publication. A later measured optimization may multiplex sessions only if Gemini CLI demonstrates correct concurrent routing. A bounded pool (for example 2–4 live binding processes) and idle eviction prevents unbounded growth.

### ACP process/connection

Resolve the installed package entry once using ESM module resolution. Launch through a small packaged supervisor/watchdog rather than detaching Gemini directly:

```text
command: process.execPath
args: [resolvedSupervisorEntry, resolvedGeminiEntry, "--acp"]
stdio: ["pipe", "pipe", "pipe"]
shell: false
windowsHide: true
detached: true on POSIX only for a dedicated killable process group
```

The supervisor transparently forwards ACP stdio, spawns Gemini without a shell, records the original Pi parent PID/IPC channel, and kills its whole child group if Pi disappears. Normal teardown signals the dedicated group. On Windows use a tested Job Object/tree-kill implementation. Do not rely solely on ACP stdin EOF: a hung agent or descriptor-inheriting grandchild may prevent it. Packed smoke tests must kill the Pi-side parent abruptly and verify the watchdog, agent, and tool grandchildren disappear. If a reliable watchdog/tree strategy is unavailable on a platform, that platform is unsupported rather than knowingly leaking detached processes.

Attach `error`, `exit`, and stream listeners before awaiting anything. Keep stdout exclusively for ACP frames and stderr as a bounded, redacted diagnostic ring. The SDK adapter owns one connection and all in-flight RPC promises.

Recommended deadlines (configuration may tune within safe bounds):

| Operation | Initial default |
|---|---:|
| Spawn + initialize | 30 s |
| Authenticate | 180 s; user interaction aware |
| Session new/model/mode | 30 s |
| Prompt idle | 120 s excluding active permission UI |
| Prompt overall | 10 min |
| Cancel grace | 1.5 s |
| SIGTERM → SIGKILL | 1 s |
| Idle process TTL | 10 min |

All deadline timers use `unref` where possible. User login and permission UI have explicit cancellation rather than an invisible fixed wall clock. While `binding.state === "awaiting-permission"`, pause prompt-idle and process-idle eviction timers; retain only the permission expiry and overall safety deadline. A late permission result for a dead generation is handled as a normal denied/failed continuation, never an unhandled rejection.

## 4. Startup and model publication

Do not spawn during extension load. `getModels()` immediately returns a conservative fallback catalog, including Gemini's `auto` alias and known stable ids validated for the pinned CLI. Mark image input according to pinned capabilities, reasoning only when thought output is supported, zero dollar costs, and conservative context/output metadata.

On explicit Pi model refresh, after login, or lazy first use:

1. Acquire/start a catalog process.
2. Initialize and authenticate using the effective provider credential/ambient Gemini store.
3. Create a neutral session rooted at the current/project cwd.
4. Read `models.availableModels/currentModelId`.
5. Validate ids/names and project into Pi models.
6. Publish an atomic cached catalog with CLI version and timestamp.
7. Close the dedicated catalog process; never bind its probe session or process to chat in v1.

If refresh fails, retain the previous/fallback list and return a diagnostic. Do not erase a good cache.

## 5. Turn flow

### New/fresh binding

```text
Pi streamSimple
  ├─ validate cwd, session id, latest input
  ├─ get/create process; initialize/authenticate
  ├─ start/refresh authenticated loopback MCP bridge for active Pi tools
  ├─ session/new(cwd, mcpServers=[piBridgeDescriptor])
  ├─ set model if currentModelId differs
  ├─ build one-time reconstruction resource
  ├─ session/prompt([images, reconstruction resource, latest text])
  ├─ map concurrent updates to Pi events
  ├─ parse PromptResponse usage/stop
  └─ commit binding watermark; emit terminal event
```

The one-time reconstruction contains Pi's system prompt, prior messages needed for continuity, and a clear data boundary. It must not instruct Gemini to replay previous tool actions. It excludes the current user content, which remains the final prompt block.

### Warm binding

Validate the context prefix fingerprint/watermark. Build only a delta of messages added since the binding last committed that Gemini could not have observed (other-provider outputs, Pi tool results, compaction summary). Send the current user message once. Prior Gemini assistant text does not need replay.

Commit the new watermark only after a completed turn. On abort/error, preserve enough state to determine whether recovery/reconstruction is required rather than assuming the session saw nothing.

### Permission continuation

When Gemini sends `session/request_permission`:

1. The ACP request stays pending in `PermissionBroker`.
2. Close any open Pi text/thinking block.
3. Emit a Pi `toolCall` for the registered `gemini_acp_permission` tool and terminate this Pi stream with `toolUse`.
4. Pi executes the permission tool, which shows/selects the choices and returns a machine-readable selection.
5. Pi invokes the provider again with that `toolResult` in context.
6. Find the parked request by an unguessable call id, verify session/generation, resolve it with the offered ACP option id, and resume reading the same ACP prompt—do **not** send another `session/prompt`.
7. Continue until the Gemini prompt ends or another round trip is required.

The binding's overall prompt deadline pauses only while Pi is actively collecting user permission. Abort resolves the ACP permission with `cancelled` and tears down as needed.

A provider restart cannot resume a parked request. Fail the turn clearly and reconstruct on the next user turn.

## 6. Context reconstruction algorithm

Store `messageWatermark` and a fingerprint of normalized message identities/content up to that point.

On each non-continuation call:

1. Identify current user input. If the tail is a provider-owned permission result, use continuation handling instead.
2. If context length is at least the watermark and prefix fingerprint matches, binding is warm.
3. If it does not match (branch, rewind, compaction, session restore, cross-process recovery), destroy the old ACP binding and reconstruct. ACP history cannot be edited or compacted retroactively.
4. For warm binding, collect external messages between watermark and current input, excluding this provider's assistant messages and internal permission bookkeeping.
5. For fresh binding, collect the latest Pi system prompt, latest compaction summary, and a bounded chronological transcript. Clearly label roles/providers/tool results.
6. Truncate by bytes/tokens, preserving system instructions, latest compaction summary, and newest messages. Add `[truncated]`; never cut Unicode code points.
7. Prefer ACP embedded `resource`; if not advertised, use a delimited text preamble.
8. Place images/resources before final user text.

Security framing should say the reconstructed transcript is untrusted conversation data, not higher-priority system policy. Pi's actual system prompt should be in a separately labeled section; ACP v1 does not provide a true system role, so this limitation is documented.

## 7. Process crash and session recovery

On unexpected exit:

- atomically mark all bindings on that generation dead;
- reject pending RPCs and permission/MCP brokers;
- suppress late events by checking generation;
- keep redacted exit code/signal/stderr tail;
- do not restart in a tight loop.

Next user request gets a fresh process/session and one-time Pi context reconstruction. This is the default reliable recovery path.

Optional cross-process load algorithm, initially disabled:

1. Persist `{piSessionId, acpSessionId, cwd, cliVersion, updatedAt}` atomically with mode 0600.
2. On compatible CLI version, run a canary-safe `session/load` with replay suppression.
3. Verify a sentinel/memory condition before trusting it.
4. On any failure or known vulnerable version, abandon load and reconstruct; never retry load repeatedly against the same upstream record.

Given open destructive load reports, shipping reconstruction first is a deliberate correctness choice.

## 8. Model switching

Before every new prompt, compare Pi's `model.id` with `binding.effectiveModelId` and current session capabilities:

- if equal: no call;
- if available and different: call `unstable_setSessionModel`, update binding only after success;
- if method changed in newer ACP: use a capability/version adapter with an integration fixture;
- if unsupported or the call fails: return a precise model error and do not prompt on the stale model; ACP `session/new` has no model parameter, so there is no valid fallback until another model-control method is explicitly implemented and tested;
- never silently continue on the old model.

Store `responseModel` from per-model usage/current updates where possible. Pi model selection and Gemini's auto-router can differ; diagnostics should make that visible.

## 9. Tool topology

### v1: Gemini-native loop

Gemini keeps core tools. ACP tool updates are display events, not Pi-executable calls. Permission requests use Pi's round trip. This avoids duplicate edits and avoids mutating user Gemini settings.

### 1.0 target: Pi tools over MCP

To satisfy first-class Pi tool and marketplace-extension compatibility, an in-process localhost MCP server advertises the active compatible `Context.tools` (excluding provider-internal tools) under an unambiguous `pi_` namespace. Start it before `session/new` and include its descriptor at session creation; update its `tools/list` view from the current Pi context. Sanitize TypeBox schemas to Gemini's accepted function-schema subset and omit incompatible tools with bounded diagnostics rather than causing a model API 400.

Gemini core tools may coexist. The reconstruction/system instructions direct Gemini to prefer `pi_` workspace tools when an equivalent exists, but prose cannot enforce routing. The security boundary must be explicit: Pi `tool_call` hooks and marketplace policies govern bridged Pi tools only; Gemini-native tools execute in the child and are governed by Gemini's permission/policy system plus the ACP permission broker. M0 must probe a per-process, non-persistent policy for excluding overlapping native tools. Use it only when it preserves MCP visibility and never mutate global Gemini settings. If no safe exclusion exists, ship the dual-loop boundary prominently documented. If the bridge itself is not ready, releases remain beta.

The MCP server parks calls rather than executing them internally. Requirements:

- unguessable bearer token and loopback binding;
- schemas converted losslessly or tools omitted;
- tool list refreshed per turn;
- no credentials exposed to Gemini;
- per-call timeout/abort/generation checks;
- explicit collision policy with Gemini core tool names;
- no `tools.core: []` workaround because of upstream #28361;
- compatibility tests proving Pi marketplace tools remain visible and execute through Pi;
- the provider-owned permission broker tool is never advertised back through MCP, preventing recursion.

Do not execute Pi tool implementations directly from provider internals; that would bypass Pi hooks, rendering, policy, and transcript handling.

## 10. State persistence

Only non-secret metadata may be stored under Pi's data directory:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-gemini-acp-provider/
  models-v1.json       # validated ACP catalog + version/timestamp
  sessions-v1.json     # optional load bindings; 0600, atomic rename
  debug/               # opt-in redacted logs with retention cap
```

Google OAuth credentials stay in Gemini CLI's store. API keys should use Pi auth storage and be injected over ACP, not written to this directory. Never persist prompt text, file content, permission diffs, stderr wholesale, or MCP bearer tokens.

## 11. Shutdown ownership

A top-level `Runtime.dispose(reason)` is idempotent:

1. reject new work;
2. cancel/deny permission and MCP requests;
3. send session cancel for active prompts;
4. close SDK transports/stdin;
5. kill remaining process groups with escalation;
6. close local MCP server;
7. clear timers/listeners/maps;
8. await all teardown promises with a bounded deadline.

Call it on Pi `session_shutdown`, extension unload/reload if exposed, process fatal conditions, and test teardown. Individual idle evictions use the same lower-level connection close path.

## 12. Architecture invariants to assert in tests

- A process generation cannot emit into a successor's stream.
- One ACP notification belongs to exactly one session/turn.
- One Pi session never shares history with another by cwd accident.
- One current user message produces at most one ACP prompt request.
- A permission result resolves only its original pending request.
- A completed Gemini tool is never executed again merely for display.
- Every open Pi block closes before switch/terminal.
- Every pending promise settles on abort/exit/dispose.
- Model id is set before prompt and never silently stale.
- Binding watermark advances only after a known terminal outcome.
